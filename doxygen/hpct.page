@section overview Overview

The HPC Toolkit (HPCT) is a library used to house various support
functions often required for application development of
high-performance, scientific applications.  The library is written in
C++, but provides an API for development in C and Fortran.  The
primary functions presently provided are a \e flexible input file
parsing method for ascii-files and a performance timing mechanism to
provide a simple summary of individual code section performance along
with basic statistics.  

Thanks for your interest in HPCT. To aid in usage, this manual is
further divided into the following subsections:

<!-- \subpage installation Installation -->
\subpage apiC "C/C++ Library Interface "
<!-- \subpage apiF Fortran API -->
<!-- \subpage examples Examples -->

<!-- PECOS brings together an interdisciplinary, multi-university team -->
<!-- including strong ties with the DOE National Labs and NASA. The goal of -->
<!-- the PECOS Center is to develop the next generation of advanced -->
<!-- computational methods for predictive simulation of multiscale, -->
<!-- multiphysics phenomena, and to apply these methods to the simulation of -->
<!-- reentry vehicles into the atmosphere.  Simulation of vehicle -->
<!-- reentry into the atmosphere is a challenging problem involving many -->
<!-- complex physical phenomena; such as, aerothermochemistry, thermal -->
<!-- radiation, turbulence and the response of complex materials to extreme -->
<!-- conditions. These arise from the interaction of extremely high -->
<!-- temperature gas flows with the vehicle's thermal protection system. -->
