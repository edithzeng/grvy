@section overview Overview

The HPC Toolkit (HPCT) is a library used to house various support
functions often required for application development of
high-performance, scientific applications.  The library is written in
C++, but provides an API for development in C and Fortran.  The
primary functions presently provided are a \e flexible input file
parsing method for ascii-files and a performance timing mechanism to
provide simple summary of individual code section performance.

@section pecos-center More Information About the PECOS Center

The <a href="http://pecos.ices.utexas.edu">Center for Predictive Engineering and Computational Sciences</a>
(PECOS) is one of five US centers sponsored under the Predictive
Science Academic Alliance Program (PSAAP) of the National Nuclear
Security Administration's Advanced Simulation and Computing
Program. The PECOS center is housed within the <a href="http://www.ices.utexas.edu">Institute for Computational
Engineering and Sciences</a> (ICES) at the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a>

PECOS brings together an interdisciplinary, multi-university team
including strong ties with the DOE National Labs and NASA. The goal of
the PECOS Center is to develop the next generation of advanced
computational methods for predictive simulation of multiscale,
multiphysics phenomena, and to apply these methods to the simulation of
reentry vehicles into the atmosphere.  Simulation of vehicle
reentry into the atmosphere is a challenging problem involving many
complex physical phenomena; such as, aerothermochemistry, thermal
radiation, turbulence and the response of complex materials to extreme
conditions. These arise from the interaction of extremely high
temperature gas flows with the vehicle's thermal protection system.
